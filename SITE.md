# Site Vision: CruiseFrnds

**Vision:** A premium social platform that connects cruise travelers before, during, and after their voyage. The site serves as both a marketing landing page and the entry point to the web application.

## 4. Sitemap
- [x] `index.html` (Home): The main landing page with hero, features, and social proof.
- [x] `destinations.html`: A curated list of popular cruise destinations and routes.
- [x] `community.html`: A social hub showing active groups, events, and traveler profiles.
- [x] `about.html`: Company mission, team, and "Why CruiseFrnds" story.

## 5. Roadmap
1.  **Destinations Page**: Showcase beautiful locations with "Find Travel Partners" calls into action.
2.  **Community Page**: Show what the social experience looks like (mock interfaces of chats/groups).
3.  **About Page**: Tell the founding story and values.

## 6. Creative Freedom
-   Experiment with "liquid" background elements on the Destinations page to mimic water.
-   Use horizontal scrolling cards for the Community groups to show breadth.
